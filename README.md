# Rules
Create a simple 3D game in which the character runs in a straight line, shoots bullets at enemies and fights the boss at the end of the match. 
Also implement the main menu interface, victory/defeat display and character enhancement system.

## Clarifications
The saving system was made using FileStreamers and JSON Converter.
The test was created for PC, and requires a keyboard and mouse to work properly, since the test page did not require a mobile build.
All additional requirements was implemented and there's no bugs according to my playtest session.
