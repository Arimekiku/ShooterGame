# Rules
Create a simple 3D game in which the character runs in a straight line, shoots bullets at enemies and fights the boss at the end of the match. 
Also implement the main menu interface, victory/defeat display and character enhancement system.

## Clarifications
The saving system was made using PlayerPrefs because simple entities were saved and there was no need to use something more complex.
There's no animations or smooth UI because due to test page graphics will not be judged.
The test was created for PC, and requires a keyboard and mouse to work properly, since the test page did not require a mobile build.
All additional requirements was implemented and there's no bugs according to my playtest session.
